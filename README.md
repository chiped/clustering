clustering
==========

A collection of Java applets that visualize different clustering algorithms. The algorithms are modified show that each step could be animated. There are four algorithms used in here. KMeans, ISODATA, FLAME and DBSCAN. Run the Plot&lt;Name>.java file as an applet to see the aniamtion. The data is randomly gnerated but you could generate it in some pattern relevant to the clustering algorithm.
